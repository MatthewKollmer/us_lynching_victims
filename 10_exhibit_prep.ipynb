    "### 1) Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebook presents my steps in code for preparing our data for the digital exhibit. These steps include narrowing the data by 'high' probability labels, making sure the data includes the necessary entries for columns crucial for the exhibit, and pulling more data from Chronicling America's API. There were some external steps not present here–mainly, those of building a prototype of the exhibit first and then testing it on samples of our data. But suffice it to say that I first built the prototype and gleaned what aspects of the data it would need to function. Then I constructed the following pipeline to make those aspects available across as much of our data as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you may notice me dropping data throughout the pipeline below. This is not a disastrous oversight. Prior to running this code, I made a copy of all our data, a copy I could prepare specifically for the exhibit. This means we have a \"core\" dataset from our previous processes and an \"exhibit\" dataset which is essentially a reconstituted subset of the core data. After running all the code below, the exhibit data contains 31,257 clippings out of what was initially 51,901 'high' probability lynching reports. It also represents 2,241 Black victims out of what was initially 3,084."
